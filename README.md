# Rise_ofthe_Restless
2015 Senior Project -- Shawnee State University

Together, a rogue, woodsman, sorceress, and warrior, must explore dark and treacherous dungeons and crypts in search of a long lost treasure. Only by using all their skills can they hope to overcome the enemies and puzzles within them, or be lost forever like so many others. Can you lead them to riches and glory?

Rise of the Restless is a dungeon crawler with up to 4 players where each player uses a character from our group of treasure seekers. Each character has their own unique abilities and their own role to fill in the group. When used together, a group of players must defeat enemies and solve puzzles to complete dungeons. These characters are:

The Warrior - A large brawler with a sword and shield who can knock back enemies using his combo attacks. With his shield, the Warrior can block most projectiles and protect his group.

The Sorceress - A young mage adept in the magic of fire and ice from a distance to devastate her enemies. Even capable of unleashing ice spikes or summoning meteors from the sky.

The Rogue - A cutthroat murderer who has mastered stealth to prey on his victims. Dashes around his enemies to ravage them with his daggers and escapes into stealth right before their eyes.

The Woodsman - A seasoned archer with his pet hawk create a formidable duo. Able to rain arrows on enemies while his hawk attacks his targets. When enemies get too close, the Woodsman just drops a satchel charge to blast them away... and never looks at the explosion.
